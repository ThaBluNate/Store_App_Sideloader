# Store App Sideloader
#### Sideload any Microsoft Store app with minimal setup!
## Using the program:
### 1: Run `Run.bat`
### 2: Wait...
### 3: It should be done!
## Making an installer:
### 1: Gather all of your Appx, AppxBundle, MSIX, or otherwise files into a zip folder.
### 2: Understand how the program works. This is important so you know how to edit the variables.
##### 2.1: First, the program extracts all of $fileArray from $zipName
##### 2.2: Then, it installs all of the extracted files
##### 2.3: Afterwards, it moves `Program Files/WindowsApps/$fromPath` to `Appdata/Local/WindowsApps/$toPath`
##### 2.4: Finally, it registers the application
### 3: Edit `sideLoad.ps1`, all lines in the image below are safe to edit.
